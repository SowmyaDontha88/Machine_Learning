# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal repository, where I keep all of my machine learning projects. Here, you can find my work on a variety of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as neural networks such as CNNs and ANNs. I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy exploring different datasets to enhance my skills and knowledge. Feel free to browse through my projects and explore the exciting world of machine learning with me.

To use any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to have the following libraries installed:

1.NumPy
2.Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4.Scikit-learn
5.TensorFlow

# Projects
Here are brief descriptions of the projects included in this repository:

All the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are placed in this repository.

# Supervised Learning: 
This folder contains projects that use supervised learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to make predictions based on labeled data.

# Unsupervised Learning: 
This folder contains projects that use unsupervised learning algorithms, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, to find patterns and structure in unlabeled data.

# Neural Networks: 
This folder contains projects that use feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to perform classification, regression, and image recognition tasks.

# Data Preprocessing: 
This folder contains projects that focus on data preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, feature selection, and feature scaling, which are essential for preparing data for machine learning algorithms.
